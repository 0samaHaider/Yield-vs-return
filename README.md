# C# Yield Example

## Overview

This simple C# program demonstrates the use of `yield` in two different methods, comparing it with a traditional method using `return`. The goal is to showcase the differences in behavior and resource utilization.

## Program Output

The program consists of two methods:

### `GetNumbersWithReturn`

- Adds numbers to a list using traditional `return`.
- Prints each step and the final list.
  
### `GetNumbersWithYield`

- Yields numbers one at a time using `yield`.
- Prints each yielded number.

## Observations

Observe the differences in behavior, memory usage, and performance between the two methods. 

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this example by suggesting improvements or additional scenarios where `yield` could be beneficial.
